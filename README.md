# GorestAPI-Testing
Description: GorestAPI is a 24/7 online fake REST API service designed for quick testing and prototyping of web and Android applications. With the help of GorestAPI, I utilized REST API's HTTP methods to perform the following actions:

•	Create User - I created a new user on GorestAPI by providing the necessary user details. This was accomplished using the HTTP method called POST.

•	Get User Details - I obtained the user details from GorestAPI using the user ID and validated various aspects such as JSON fields, status code, data types, JSON schema, etc. This was achieved using the HTTP method called GET.

•	Update User Details - I updated the user details on GorestAPI by utilizing the user ID of the specific user. This was accomplished using the HTTP method called PUT.

•	Crosscheck Updated Details: I retrieved the user details once again by providing the user ID and cross-verified the updated information. This was done using the HTTP method called GET.

•	Delete User: Finally, I deleted the user by utilizing the user ID. This was achieved using the HTTP method called DELETE.
